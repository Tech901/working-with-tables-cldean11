    <p>Because I'm a Tar Heel Born & Bred!! Rah Rah Rah!</p>


    <p>I have now created a new branch and switched to it, this is where I will do my coding add my images, etc. You
        could have already added your images, that would be fine as well!</p>

    <h4>Now let's pretend I'm finished, or close to finished, or even just at a good stopping point. I want to save my
        work here then push my code to github and let my instructor know that I have some code ready for review or some
        questions about my code. </h4>
